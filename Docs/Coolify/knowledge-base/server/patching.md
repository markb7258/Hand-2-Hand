On this page, you'll see a list of all available package updates.

You can either:
  - Update packages **individually** by clicking the **Update** button next to each one.
  - Or, click **Update All Packages** to apply all updates at once.

::: warning Note
  Coolify **does not** automatically install updates. It only checks for available updates and displays them in the dashboard.
  
  Updates are applied only when you manually click the **Update** or **Update All Packages** button.

## Server Patching Notifications
Coolify checks for updates weekly and sends notifications if any are available.
