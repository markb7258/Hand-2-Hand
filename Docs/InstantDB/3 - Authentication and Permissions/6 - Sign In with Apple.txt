Implement signInPopup using clientName from Step 4:

async function signInPopup() {
  let nonce = crypto.randomUUID();

  // authenticate with Apple
  let resp = await AppleID.auth.signIn({
    nonce: nonce,
    usePopup: true,
  });

  // authenticate with Instant
  await db.auth.signInWithIdToken({
    clientName: '<clientName>',
    idToken: resp.authorization.id_token,
    nonce: nonce,
  });
